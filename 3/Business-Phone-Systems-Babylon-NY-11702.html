<p>Transform your business with cloud-based hosted VoIP. Keeping digital phones require technician on-site. And, when things are up and running once again, re-connect your phones as previously and you're back in business with high quality call. The ATA adapter sits in between the old phone system and the new NBN internet connection, transforming the data so that your business can run NBN voice. IP telephones require a 'working' and accredited data cable which can be shared or committed, that returns to a patch panel, connects to the switch via a patch cable television, then routes to the system accordingly.</p>
<p>An IP-based PBX service can see the user from anywhere based on IP procedures, so the user has a virtualized experience and distributed voice calls.

These are the standard phones found on many office desks and in your homes.</p>
